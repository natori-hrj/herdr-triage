# Produce target/release/herdr-triage, preferring a prebuilt binary from GitHub Releases.
#
# herdr runs this as the plugin's [[build]] step, with the plugin directory as cwd.
# Installing a plugin should not require a Rust toolchain, so try a signed-by-checksum
# download first; fall back to `cargo build --release` when anything at all goes wrong
# (no release for this version, unknown platform, no network, checksum mismatch).
#
# The fallback is not an error path — it is the guaranteed path. A failed download must
# never be worse than not having tried, so every failure here is non-fatal until the very
# end, where cargo either succeeds or the install legitimately fails.
#
# Kept deliberately close to herdr-lazy's script of the same name, so a fix in one transfers
# to the other.
